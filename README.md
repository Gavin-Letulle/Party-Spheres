##### Playing the actual game
- Click on a circle.
- Click on the action that results in the best happiness outcome for the player.
- This is determined by looking at the colored circles next to each character.
- A green "C" means that a character likes compliments, a yellow "I" means the character is neutral about invites, and a red "H" means that a character dislikes help.
- Look at each circle and decide what the best move is based on what you see.
- Clicking on an action for a circle where all three characters like that action, will give you the most amount of points.
- The Happiness bar will automatically deplete every 4 seconds, but making smart moves will increment the bar and keep you alive.
- When the Happiness bar reaches 0, it is game over.
- Try to see how many points you can reach before you run out of happiness!
